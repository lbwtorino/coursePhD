1) Give a general background -> give specific background -> Mention previous
research
2) Look for a niche
3) Introduce your own paper -> State your research aims


- Motivate problem, show that it's an important and difficult problem
  - Solve a very specific problem
- Paint the research landscape, explain deficiency of current state of
  the art, explain what aspect your research addresses. Explain how
  the current paper fits into the research landscape.
  What is the ultimate research goal in this area? How does the
  current paper help to get us closer towards that goal?
- Explain what the main research challenge is, why is it a difficult
  and important problem? This is very important, if the audience
  agrees that the challenge is difficult (they don't know how to solve
  it) and important, the paper is almost already accepted.
  State interesting questions that the paper addresses.
- Provide a very explicit, verifiable claim for a metric for approach
  (we propose system X with property Y, Y must be easy to measure and
   clear to see merit wrt related work)
  If one can show that we made verifiable progress on a relevant
  problem, then the paper cannot be rejected :-)
- Explain KEY CONCEPTS / INSIGHTS that the paper introduces
- Pose a list of QUESTIONS! Readers love puzzles, and ideally, the
  paper contains several questions that the reader will try to answer
  but can't, then once the answer is in the paper the reader says: great!
- List of CONTRIBUTIONS
